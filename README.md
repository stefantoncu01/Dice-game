# Dice-game
Interactive game using Python 

I have created an interactive game using Python and OOP that has the following characteristics:
- the player determines the winning score at the beginning of the game
- the players (human and computer) have to roll the dice to determine who will start the game
- the first player will roll the dice. If it rolls a double, he must roll again. 
- the first player to reach the winning score is the winner.

PS: the player can choose to continue the game or not. If he forfeits, the computer will win the game regardless of the score.
